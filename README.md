# Convert image to ASCII shell print

This app was created purly for private use and out of curiosity. I had a desire to experiment with openCV library. This is one of few experimenting with this image manipulation library.

Basic functionality:
* App is mostly controlled with inputs via shell
* After compiling, a menu with all the options shows up
* User is required to enter desired option. Note that some options are locked until user performes previous steps
* The steps are numbered on the menu
* Enter 'X' or 'x' to close the app
